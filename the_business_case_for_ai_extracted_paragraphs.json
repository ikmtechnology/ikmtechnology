Due to shortages and delays in tests, chest X- rays became the most convenient and affordable way for doctors to triage patients.

In a 2017 survey of one hundred global manufacturers, researchers found that 23% of all unplanned downtime resulted from human error.9 Errors can be costly: they can result in discarding manufactured parts, prolonged customer follow-ups, a lengthy root cause analysis, and sometimes, errors can cost lives.

Moreover, the infrastructure necessary for big data storage and high-powered computing is now available as cloud services that companies can \u201crent\u201d as needed. As a result, companies no longer need to store large amounts of data in their own data centers, nor do they have to purchase expensive supercomputers.

Specifically, how and why did the deep learning model arrive at a specific answer? The \u201cblack box\u201d nature of deep learning has become problematic in applications such as medical diagnosis and therapy. For example, if a deep learning model predicts that a patient is at risk for lung cancer, why did it arrive at that conclusion? It\u2019s critical for a doctor to understand this, but because of deep learning\u2019s black box nature, it may never be clear why."

You\u2019ll most likely require some preparatory work, such as training executives, upskilling employees, hiring data scientists or consultants, and getting your data infrastructure in place. All of this requires a significant financial investment. Further, without an IT team or software engineering support, you\u2019d incur additional expense to integrate AI solutions into existing workflows."

Cutting too many corners can have long-term repercussions and hurt your customer experience even without you knowing. For example, say you stop data collection initiatives to cut costs and instead start relying on publicly available datasets to develop ML models. There is a risk that the resulting models would be of low quality as they are not trained on good data. When models are of low quality, they will make gross errors, hurting your business in various ways."

This resulted in a significant increase in output, and because of this, the price of cloth started to fall.

The development teams of self-driving vehicles are still struggling to make self-driving cars fully autonomous. Although Google\u2019s Waymo is piloting a fully autonomous taxi service, it\u2019s still on a very small scale.33 Trying to replicate human driving is a very ambitious task. It requires the complex coming together of cameras, radar, sensors, and AI to enable vehicles to travel between destinations without a human operator. Which is why even though the idea of self-driving cars has been around since the late 1920s, only now, with the advancement of technology such as deep learning on the AI side, we\u2019re seeing greater progress."

First, we discussed the potential of AI in your business, such as helping eliminate inefficiencies, reducing human errors, and even boosting revenues. We also learned what precisely AI means in the context of business, where we went into the topics of ML, deep learning, NLP, computer vision, and robotics. Further, to shape some initial thinking around getting value from AI, we discussed several tips to maximize AI success, which we\u2019ll be discussing more in Parts 3\u20135 of this book. Finally, we debunked some myths surrounding AI to help you start the coming chapters with a clear mind. With your thinking properly framed around AI, it\u2019s time to dig deeper and start generating ideas for your business."

You may be wondering, Why is any of this helpful? First, it gives you opportunities to build brand loyalty by keeping customers on your platform longer. Then, as a result of customers interacting with your brand extensively, you\u2019re collecting a lot more data about your customers\u2019 likes and dislikes.

Even though this dataset could resemble your company emails, it\u2019s not the same. The topics of discussion and spam content could look very different.

Had Tay been subjected to different types of tweet engagements during PDT, the dangers of releasing Tay would\u2019ve become obvious. (As you know, Tay was shut down sixteen hours after release.) So, I repeat, post-development testing is absolutely necessary. Experienced data scientists usually integrate some of this testing during the model development stage. In practice, I often see models going directly from development to deployment without any form of testing.

The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and starting on the first one.\u201d \u2014Mark Twain In the previous chapter, we discussed B-CIDS, the five pillars for AI preparation. Each pillar is critical, with its own set of requirements for building an AI-ready company. However, trying to work on all pillars simultaneously is not practical, especially if you\u2019re new to AI. Plus, it sometimes takes years to perfect the implementation of a single pillar."

At present, ReviewCrunch\u2019s analysts work twelve-hour days to get through analyzing a certain number of reviews. Say they want to see a 50% reduction in review analysis time (i.e., a six-hour reduction a day). We can start measuring the ROAI by setting it up in this way: Metric: review analysis time Baseline Measurement: twelve hours per day per analyst Expected ROAI: 50% reduction in time to analyze reviews Here\u2019s another example. Let\u2019s look at ReviewCrunch\u2019s \u201cimprove analyst work-life balance\u201d benefit. An indirect way to measure this would be to evaluate analyst turnover. You can look at the current turnover and determine what\u2019s ideal. (Recall that ReviewCrunch has five analysts.) Say that the current turnover is 60% a year, and ideally, it should be 20%. We can prepare to measure the ROAI as follows: Metric: analyst turnover Baseline Measurement: 60% turnover a year Expected ROAI: 67% reduction in analyst turnover In both examples, the ROAI (improvement over the baseline measurement) can be computed during PDT (post-development testing) and after deployment to see how things are progressing against the expected ROAI. Each metric will have its corresponding ROAI measurement. However, keep in mind that since the expected ROAI is a goal, it may take several iterations before your ROAI nears the expected ROAI. The following image illustrates how this works. We\u2019ll also explore more of this in Chapter 14."

A feasibility assessment can be in the following form: Type-a: A close review of your framed PAI Type-b: The above and exploratory data analysis Type-c: All of the above and a prototype of the AI solution Through feasibility analysis, experts will get to dig deeper into your AI initiatives. At this point, they may find gaps that you need to address or other red flags that were not initially obvious. For example, if there is an issue with data quality, experts can bring that to your attention and guide you on improving data quality before implementation. Additionally, through a type-c feasibility analysis, they\u2019ll also be able to provide an accurate assessment of whether it can be done."

First, over time, if you hire your own data scientists, they will develop a good understanding of your existing data stores and company infrastructure. This is important as they can better support AI initiatives at every phase of the AI development life cycle. For instance, they can quickly explore your data stores to answer questions during planning or promptly prepare datasets during development. The continuity in knowledge and familiarity with internal processes can speed up ongoing AI development.

On a scale of 1\u20135, you can use 3 as the threshold for acceptable quality. For example, if ReviewCrunch meets its ProdPerform target or is very close to it, we can assign a score of 3 because the model has reached the minimum acceptable quality. If it exceeds the target, we can assign a higher score, and if it\u2019s way off, a much lower score than 3. If each pillar receives a \u201cstrength score\u201d of 3 and above, you can consider it safe to deploy and choose to stop iterations. Alternatively, you can integrate and iterate in the background. Scoring is optional, but if you feel it simplifies decision-making, then go ahead and assign scores for each of the three areas of success."
